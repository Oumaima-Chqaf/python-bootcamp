## Overview
This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course.
Using practical examples, you will learn the fundamentals
of Python data structures such as lists and arrays and much more technics and libraries that will help to use python as your programming language in your future projects.
